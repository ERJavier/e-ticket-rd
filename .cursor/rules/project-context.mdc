# Dominican Republic E-Ticket System Modernization Project

## Project Overview

This project is focused on modernizing the Dominican Republic's E-Ticket system for migration control, currently available at <https://eticket.migracion.gob.do/>. The goal is to create a modern, secure, and user-friendly digital platform for travelers entering or departing the country.

For detailed project context, see [executive-summary.md](mdc:docs/product/executive-summary.md).

## Key Objectives

- **User Experience Enhancement**: Develop a mobile-first application with passport scanning capabilities, offline data entry, and streamlined user flows
- **Technical Modernization**: Build a stable, scalable, and secure backend architecture with API-driven design
- **Accessibility & Internationalization**: Provide multilingual support and ensure WCAG 2.1/2.2 AA compliance
- **Integration**: Facilitate seamless integration with airline systems, eGates, and government services

## Benchmark Systems

The project uses New Zealand's Traveller Declaration (NZTD) and Singapore's Arrival Card (SGAC) as benchmarks for best practices in digital migration systems.

## Technology Stack

This is a **Next.js** project using:
- App Router architecture (`src/app/`)
- TypeScript for type safety
- Modern React patterns and components

## File Structure Patterns

When working with this codebase, focus on these key areas:

### Frontend Components & Pages
- `src/app/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}` - App Router pages and layouts
- `src/components/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}` - Reusable UI components
- `src/lib/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}` - Utility functions and shared logic

### Styling & Assets
- `src/styles/**/*.{css,scss,module.css}` - Stylesheets
- `public/**/*` - Static assets (images, icons, etc.)

### Configuration & Documentation
- `*.{json,js,ts,mjs}` - Configuration files (Next.js, TypeScript, ESLint, etc.)
- `docs/**/*.md` - Project documentation
- `README.md` - Main project documentation

## Development Guidelines

When contributing to this project, keep in mind:

1. **Mobile-First Design**: Prioritize mobile user experience
2. **Accessibility**: Ensure all components meet WCAG standards
3. **Internationalization**: Design with multilingual support in mind
4. **Performance**: Optimize for users with varying internet connectivity
5. **Security**: Handle sensitive traveler data with appropriate security measures

## Current Focus Areas

Based on the executive summary, the project addresses these critical pain points from the current system:
- Browser compatibility issues
- Poor mobile experience
- Complex and lengthy forms
- Inconsistent QR code usage
- Technical glitches and data loss
- Third-party scam websites
