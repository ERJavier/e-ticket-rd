# Auto-Fill Travel Direction and Smart Field Defaults

## Overview

This feature enhancement adds intelligent auto-fill capabilities to the Dominican Republic E-Ticket system, reducing manual data entry and improving user experience by automatically detecting travel direction and providing smart defaults for related travelers.

## Features Implemented

### 1. üõ´ Auto-Detect Travel Direction

**What it does:** Automatically determines whether a traveler is "Entering" or "Leaving" Dominican Republic based on flight information.

**How it works:**

- When a user enters a flight number and the system successfully looks up the flight details
- The system checks the origin and destination airport codes
- If departing from a Dominican Republic airport (PUJ, SDQ, STI, POP, LRM, JBQ, AZS) ‚Üí sets to "Leaving"
- If arriving at a Dominican Republic airport ‚Üí sets to "Entering"
- Shows a helpful alert explaining the auto-detection with airport codes

**Dominican Republic Airports Supported:**

- `PUJ` - Punta Cana International Airport
- `SDQ` - Las Am√©ricas International Airport (Santo Domingo)
- `STI` - Cibao International Airport (Santiago)
- `POP` - Gregorio Luper√≥n International Airport (Puerto Plata)
- `LRM` - Casa de Campo International Airport (La Romana)
- `JBQ` - Dr. Joaqu√≠n Balaguer International Airport (La Isabela)
- `AZS` - El Catey International Airport (Saman√°)

**User Experience:**

- Auto-detection only happens if travel direction is not already selected
- Users can still manually change the direction if needed
- Clear feedback message shows which airports were detected
- Saves users from having to manually select this obvious choice

### 2. üè† Smart Nationality Defaults

**What it does:** Automatically suggests nationality based on birth country and provides family inheritance options.

**Birth Country Auto-Suggestion:**

- When a user selects their birth country, the system suggests the same country as their nationality
- Special handling for Dominican Republic - suggests "Dominican Republic" nationality
- Only auto-fills if the nationality field is currently empty
- Shows a helpful alert explaining the auto-suggestion

**Family Nationality Inheritance:**

- For family groups (not friends or colleagues), companion travelers get an option to copy nationality from the lead traveler
- Shows a "Copy Nationality" button when:
  - Travel type is "Family"
  - Lead traveler has already entered their nationality
  - Current traveler has a different or empty nationality
- One-click inheritance to reduce repetitive data entry

### 3. ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Connection Validation

**What it does:** Validates that connecting flights make logical sense when travelers have multi-leg journeys.

**Validation Checks:**

- **Airport Matching:** Ensures the arrival airport of the first flight matches the departure airport of the second flight
- **Connection Time:** Warns about very short connections (< 45 minutes) or very long layovers (> 24 hours)
- **Shows appropriate alerts:**
  - ‚ùå **Error:** Connection mismatch between airports
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Connection time too short/long
  - ‚úÖ **Success:** Connection appears valid

**User Experience:**

- Validation happens automatically when both origin and main flights are successfully looked up
- Non-intrusive alerts provide clear guidance
- Helps prevent impossible itineraries before submission

## Technical Implementation

### New Utility Functions (`src/lib/utils/flight-utils.ts`)

```typescript
// Dominican Republic airport detection
function isDominicanAirport(airportCode: string): boolean;

// Auto-detect travel direction
function autoDetectTravelDirection(
  originCode: string,
  destinationCode: string
): "ENTRY" | "EXIT" | null;

// Validate flight connections
function validateFlightConnection(
  firstFlightDestination: string,
  secondFlightOrigin: string,
  firstFlightArrival?: string,
  secondFlightDeparture?: string
): { isValid: boolean; error?: string; warning?: string };

// Smart nationality suggestions
function suggestNationalityFromBirthCountry(
  birthCountry: string
): string | null;
```

### Updated Components

#### Flight Info Step (`src/components/forms/steps/flight-info-step.tsx`)

- Enhanced with auto-detection logic in flight lookup useEffect
- Added visual feedback for auto-detected travel direction
- Added connection validation for multi-leg journeys
- Shows appropriate alerts based on validation results

#### Migratory Info Section (`src/components/forms/components/migratory-info-section.tsx`)

- Enhanced birth country field with nationality auto-suggestion
- Added family nationality inheritance component
- Visual feedback for auto-suggested values
- Copy nationality functionality for family groups

### Form Integration

The enhancements integrate seamlessly with the existing TanStack Form architecture:

- Auto-fill happens during form field validation and onChange events
- Preserves existing form state and validation rules
- Does not override user-entered values
- Provides clear visual feedback for all auto-fill actions

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Auto-Detect Travel Direction

1. User selects travel date
2. User enters flight number "AA1234"
3. System looks up flight: JFK ‚Üí SDQ
4. System automatically sets travel direction to "Entering Dominican Republic"
5. Alert shows: "Auto-detected: Based on your flight from JFK to SDQ, we've detected you're entering the Dominican Republic. You can change this if needed."

### Example 2: Nationality Auto-Suggestion

1. User selects "Dominican Republic" as birth country
2. System automatically suggests "Dominican Republic" for nationality
3. Alert shows: "Auto-suggested: Based on your birth country (Dominican Republic), we've suggested this nationality. You can change it if needed."

### Example 3: Family Nationality Inheritance

1. Lead traveler enters "United States" as nationality
2. Family member (child) sees option: "Family travel: Use the same nationality as the main traveler (United States)?"
3. User clicks "Copy Nationality" button
4. Nationality field auto-fills with "United States"

### Example 4: Connection Validation

1. User enters origin flight: "LH441" (FRA ‚Üí JFK)
2. User enters main flight: "AA1234" (JFK ‚Üí SDQ)
3. System validates connection
4. Shows: "‚úÖ Connection Validated: Your flight connection appears valid."
