# Quick Reference: Data Simplification Opportunities

## Executive Summary

The current Dominican Republic E-Ticket system makes users enter the same information multiple times. We found **7 main areas** where we can reduce user input by **~60% overall** while improving accuracy and user satisfaction.

## Top Priority Simplifications

### 🏠 **Address Sharing for Families**

- **Current**: Each family member enters full address
- **New**: "Do all travelers share the same address?" → auto-populate
- **Impact**: 70% fewer address fields for groups

### ✈️ **Smart Flight Numbers**

- **Current**: Manual entry of airline, departure/arrival ports
- **New**: Enter flight number → auto-fill all flight details
- **Impact**: 60% less flight-related data entry

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Family Contact Sharing**

- **Current**: Each person enters email/phone
- **New**: Choose main family contact, share when appropriate
- **Impact**: 50% less contact information redundancy

### 🛃 **Family Customs Declarations**

- **Current**: Each person answers identical customs questions
- **New**: "Are you traveling as a family unit?" → shared declarations
- **Impact**: 40% less customs redundancy

## Smart Form Logic Examples

### **Family Travel Detection**

```text
If travel_type = "family" AND relationship = "spouse/child":
  → Offer to share address, contact info, customs declarations
  → Auto-populate nationality for children born in same country as parents
```

### **Smart Flight Numbers**

```text
If flight_number = "AA8838":
  → airline = "American Airlines"
  → departure_port = "Miami (MIA)"
  → arrival_port = "Santo Domingo (SDQ)"
  → flight_date checking against actual schedules
```

### **Purpose-Based Forms**

```text
If travel_purpose = "tourism" AND duration < 30_days:
  → Use simple customs form
  → Skip business-related questions
  → Focus on standard tourist allowances
```
