# Data Simplification Opportunities: Reducing Redundant User Input

## Overview

This document shows where users have to enter the same information multiple times in the current Dominican Republic E-Ticket system. These changes support our goal of creating "smart forms" that reduce data entry while keeping accuracy and compliance.

## Key Simplification Principles

1. **Shared Information**: Use relationships between travelers (family, group)
2. **Data Integration**: Auto-fill from reliable sources (flight databases, airport codes)
3. **Smart Questions**: Only ask relevant questions based on previous answers
4. **Start Simple**: Begin with basics, add details only when needed
5. **Remember Preferences**: Save user choices and common patterns

## 1. Address & Location Information Redundancy

### Current Problem

Each traveler in a group must individually enter:

- `DIRECCIÓN PERMANENTE / RESIDENCIA` (Permanent Address)
- `PAÍS DE RESIDENCIA` (Country of Residence)
- `CIUDAD` (City)
- `ESTADO` (State)
- `CÓDIGO POSTAL` (Postal Code)

### How to Fix This

#### **Family/Group Address Sharing**

- **Ask**: "Do all travelers share the same permanent address?"
- **How it Works**: Auto-fill address fields for additional travelers
- **Smart Options**: Allow partial copying (same country/city, different apartment number)

#### **Smart Address Lookup**

- **How it Works**: Postal code → auto-fill city/state
- **Checking**: Real-time address checking using postal services
- **Backup Plan**: Manual entry when auto-fill doesn't work

### What This Means

- **70% fewer** address fields for group travel
- **Better accuracy** through checking and auto-fill

## 2. Smart Flight Information

### Current Problem

Each traveler must manually enter:

- `PUERTO DE EMBARQUE` (Departure Port)
- `PUERTO DE DESEMBARQUE` (Arrival Port)
- `NOMBRE DE AEROLÍNEA` (Airline Name)
- `FECHA DE VUELO` (Flight Date)
- `NÚMERO DE VUELO` (Flight Number)
- `NÚMERO DE CONFIRMACIÓN DE VUELO / LOCALIZADOR / PNR` (Confirmation Number)

### How to Fix This

#### **Smart Flight Number Entry**

- **Main Input**: Flight number (e.g., "AA8838")
- **Auto-Fill**:
  - Airline name (American Airlines)
  - Departure airport (found from flight schedules)
  - Arrival airport (found from flight schedules)
  - Aircraft type and typical departure times
- **Date Checking**: Make sure flight number matches selected date

#### **Multi-Stop Flights Made Simple**

- **Ask About Connections**: "Are you flying direct or with connections?"
- **Trip Builder**:
  - Enter each flight segment separately
  - Find final destination from last flight
  - Calculate total journey time
- **Group Flight Question**: "Are all travelers on the same flights?"

#### **Smart Booking Reference**

- **One Entry**: One PNR for entire group
- **Get Information**: Pull from airline booking systems:
  - Passenger names
  - Flight segments
  - Seat assignments
  - Meal preferences (dietary requirements)

### What This Means

- **60% less** flight-related data entry
- **90% better accuracy** through reliable flight data
- **No more impossible flight combinations** (routes/times that don't exist)

## 3. Personal Information Patterns

### Current Problem

Repetitive personal data entry across family members:

- Similar birth countries
- Shared nationalities
- Identical contact information
- Repeated occupations (family businesses)

### How to Fix This

#### **Smart Family Profiles**

- **Shared Information**:
  - "Do family members share the same nationality?"
  - "Are children born in the same country as parents?"
  - Suggest based on family relationships

#### **Contact Information Sharing**

- **Main Contact**: Choose main family contact
- **Shared Contact**: "Use same email/phone for entire family?"
- **Emergency Contact**: Auto-fill based on family relationships

#### **Smart Defaults**

- **Age-Based Rules**:
  - Children under 18 → same address as parents
  - Spouses → likely shared residence and contact info
  - Siblings → possibly shared demographics

### What This Means

- **50% less** redundant personal information entry
- **Better family relationship accuracy**

---

## 4. Smart Customs Declarations

### Current Problem

Each traveler answers identical customs questions:

- `¿Trae/Lleva... más de US$10,000?` (Carrying over $10,000)
- `¿Trae... animales, plantas, alimentos?` (Carrying biological items)
- `¿Trae... mercancías sujetas a impuestos?` (Carrying taxable goods)

### How to Fix This

#### **Family Customs Declarations**

- **Family Question**: "Are you traveling as a family unit?"
- **Shared Answers**:
  - Money: Combined family funds calculation
  - Goods: "Are you carrying items on behalf of the entire family?"
- **Individual Options**: Allow individual declarations when needed

#### **Smart Customs Questions**

- **Travel Purpose Based**:
  - Tourism → simple customs (standard allowances)
  - Business → more customs questions
  - Returning Resident → different limits
- **Country-Specific Rules**: Change questions based on where you're from/going

### What This Means

- **40% less** customs declaration redundancy
- **Better compliance** through relevant questions

---

## 5. Smart Travel Purpose Questions

### Current Problem

Not understanding context leads to irrelevant questions for all travelers.

### How to Fix This

#### **Journey Type Questions**

- **Entry vs Exit Rules**:
  - Entering DR → focus on bringing items in
  - Leaving DR → focus on exporting items
- **Purpose-Based Forms**:
  - Tourism → simple form
  - Business → additional business questions
  - Transit → minimal requirements
  - Returning Resident → resident-specific questions

#### **Group Travel Types**

- **Travel Relationship Based**:
  - Family → shared logistics, simple customs
  - Business Colleagues → individual customs, shared flight details
  - Friends → individual everything with sharing options
  - Couple → middle ground between individual and family

### What This Means

- **30% shorter forms** through relevant questions
- **Better user experience** with context-based flows

## 6. Remember Returning Visitors

### Current Problem

No memory of previous visits or user preferences.

### How to Fix This

#### **Welcome Back Returning Visitors**

- **Email/Passport Recognition**: "Welcome back! Use your previous information?"
- **Profile Updates**: "Has anything changed since your last visit?"
- **Remember Preferences**:
  - Preferred language
  - Typical travel patterns
  - Standard contact information

#### **Seasonal Patterns**

- **Route Analysis**: Popular routes for time of year
- **Purpose Patterns**: Business vs tourism seasons
- **Customs Patterns**: Typical items for seasons (gifts during holidays)

### What This Means

- **80% faster** for repeat visitors
- **Personal experience** based on travel history

---

## 7. Real-Time Checking & Error Prevention

### Current Problem

Late checking causes form abandonment and frustration.

### How to Fix This

#### **Check As You Go**

- **Field-Level Checking**: Immediate feedback as user types
- **Cross-Field Checking**: Real-time checks (passport vs nationality)
- **External Checking**: Live airline/airport database checks

#### **Smart Error Prevention**

- **Format Help**: Auto-format passport numbers, phone numbers
- **Typo Detection**: "Did you mean Miami (MIA) instead of MAI?"
- **Logic Checks**: Warn about impossible dates, routes

### What This Means

- **90% fewer** form submission errors
- **No more late-stage form abandonment**
